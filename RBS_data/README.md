**File formatting**

This folder contains the processed NGS data that were used by our machine learning model and other analyses. The data is structured in tab delimited files with header line containing the time points in minutes and the calculated integral of flipping profiles (_IFP480_). The data of the biological replicates (_uASPIre_RBS_300k_r2.txt.gz_ and _...r3_) also contain a column with the IFP value normalized to replicate 1 (_IFP480_fittor1_). The column _total_reads_ shows the sum of all flipped and non-flipped reads over all time points per variant.
